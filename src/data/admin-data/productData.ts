<div class="item__content">Due to factors that often affect international shipments, such as holidays, customs, and weather delays, we can only offer an estimate of shipping times. If any of the above scenarios occur with your package we promise to keep you well informed with as much information that is available to us.</div>
<div class="item__content">Then the estimated delivery date is calculated with the formula below:</div>
<div class="item__content">Estimated Delivery Date = Purchasing date + 2-5 business days (process for stocking) + Estimated shipping time (chart below)</div>
<div class="item__content">&nbsp;</div>

This usually takes between 2-7 days on average, although it can take as long as 8-12 days.</div>
